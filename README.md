## NOTE From Developer

Hello, my name is Putra, 
I'm using Vue JS with State management of Vuex in this case, you may wonder, why I'm using this framework ? 

First I can make components out of vue, actually I can also use reactjs, but this is just personal preference, 

Second, with vuex I can easily fetching api using axios which you will see on src/store/index.js

Third, I can also configure the seo according to schema.org, and can be interchangeable to nuxt.js in case you need more SEO 'Muscle-Power'
